# Research by Ethan Berney

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository contains original research developed by Ethan Berney in the fields of mathematical theory, cryptographic protocol design, and macroeconomic modeling. The work supports ongoing exploration into entropy-based validation systems, user-centric value attribution, and structural interaction with decentralized ledger technology.

## ðŸ“‚ Included Work

| Title | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Ethanâ€™s Number** | A novel mathematical constant derived from the natural logarithmic relationship between Ï€ and e. Explored across convergence theory, fractal systems, and transcendental identity. |
| **RFID Blockchain Protocol** | Cryptographic mechanism linking physical assets to blockchain identity using IPFS and Ethereum. Designed for decentralized validation and supply chain transparency. |
| **Macroeconomic Models** | Predictive frameworks analyzing monetary flow, volatility, and systemic liquidity patterns on a global scale. |
| **Prime Number Theory Framework** | Exploratory modeling on entropy patterns in prime distribution, including attempts to quantitate adjacent gaps and structural convergence. |
| **Published Research** | Peer-reviewed article on nanoparticulate drug delivery systems for glioblastoma, published in the *Journal of Oncology*. |
